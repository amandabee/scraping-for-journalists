# Lecture, Week 1

We're going to start by scraping a table of MLB Players. 



Look at a complex site, eg. NY State Nursing Home inspections. They provide an MS Access database, but we could scrape it. Let's walk through how we'd do that: what's the pattern?

* For each letter of the alphabet, there's a page with a table.
* On each page, there's a report on that nursing home. The URLs follow a pattern. 

We're going to learn some really basic programming, but it always starts with understanding the problem. 

Homework: Pick one letter of the alphabet and scrape the list of nursing homes for that letter. 

If you get stuck, file an issue in our git repo, but otherwise, I want you to work alone. I know it is harder that way. That's the point.

Basic "For" Loops

We can say out loud what we want here: for each letter, A-Z, pull up that page and scrape the table off of it.

We're not going to talk a lot about form but let's talk a little about form: PEP standards, separating out functional chunks as functions. 

Homework: Need four or five "for each" options
