Potential Projects:



Here's a challenge:

If you want structured data on NYS nursing homes, from reports like this:
http://nursinghomes.nyhealth.gov/nursing_homes/inspection/4

You need to figure out how to get it. 


Pattern:

For the letters A - Z, open a URL like:
http://nursinghomes.nyhealth.gov/searches/alpha/A



For each nursing home ID, open a URL like: 
http://nursinghomes.nyhealth.gov/nursing_homes/inspection/4



# Iterate
http://nursinghomes.nyhealth.gov/searches/alpha/A

Create a table of name, id, town, county. 

Skills: iterate through a list (in this case, the alphabet); extract a table; extract a portion of a URL

# Complex Pages
http://nursinghomes.nyhealth.gov/nursing_homes/inspection/4

Skills: understand the page structure; find the "kit container" div classes; pull the ranking from graphic.
